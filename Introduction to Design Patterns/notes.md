# Design Patterns

Set of solutions used for common problems in software design.

## Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

Step 5a: The Role of volatile
Question: Why is this code still unsafe without volatile?
Answer: Because of two issues:
1. Instruction reordering: Object creation is not atomic. It consists
   of:
   (a) Allocate memory.
   (b) Initialize the object.
   (c) Assign reference to the variable.
   Without volatile, steps (2) and (3) can be reordered. Another thread
   might see a non-null reference to a half-constructed object.
2. Caching and visibility: Without volatile, one thread may update
   its CPU cache with the new object reference, while other threads still
   see null.


Solution: Declare the instance as volatile. This ensures:
‚Ä¢ Visibility: All writes are immediately visible to other threads.

‚Ä¢ Ordering: A ‚Äúhappens-before‚Äù relationship guarantees object con-
struction completes before reference assignment.

üîπ Why Reflection Cannot Break Enum

This is because:

The Java Language Specification mandates that enum constructors are always private.

The JVM itself prevents reflective creation of enum instances ‚Äî it checks and blocks it at runtime.

Enum constants are created only once by the classloader during initialization.

So you cannot bypass it like a normal class.
